      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Overview</h2>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Our project aims to explore how GDP, government expenditure, tourism-related 
          prices, and unemployment rate are related factors that guide a country through economic crisis management strategies.<br><br>
          We first use global tourism, inflation rate, and unemployment rate as our key macroeconomic factors between 
          the years of 2013 and 2015 to identify outlier countries. Greece stands out, so we then zoom in using 
          long-run Greece time-series data (1971–2025) and regional (NUTS-2) indicators to examine why unemployment 
          (especially among young workers) remained so persistent.</h3> 
        <p><b>Tying in global patterns to a case study of Greece, our selected outlier:</b> <br>The 2008 Economic crisis caused global macroeconomic shocks, affecting unemployment rates, 
          the amount of GDP generated from tourism and other industries relying on the amount of spending money 
          people have, and housing prices. In the several years that followed, many countries were able to stabilize their
          economies by increasing government spending, lowering interest rates, and implementing tax cuts.<sup><a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/great-recession-and-its-aftermath"><cite>[1]</cite></a></sup>
          <br>
          We gathered a dataset which included global economic factors collected from the World Bank, focusing
          on international tourist arrivals per country, GDP, and inflation rates per country. After preprocessing our data, we started to
          take note of outliers; Greece, for example, has the highest unemployment rate in our filtered
          version of the data, but their other factors (inflation, GDP, and tourism arrivals) do not seem to
          match the county’s high unemployment. To answer the question of why exactly Greece had such
          high unemployment between 2013-2015, we will do a deeper dive into its government spending
          and the differences between the male and female unemployment rates.
      </p><br>
      <h2 style="color: navy;"> Research Question: What structural and macroeconomic factors shaped Greece’s prolonged unemployment crisis between 2013 and 2015, and how did these factors disproportionately affect youth across regions?</h4>
      <h4>To help answer this question, we combine a broader context of long-run macroeconomic data for Greece between the years of 1971–2025 with regional (NUTS-2) data on educational attainment and youth unemployment. 
        Using a mix of correlation analysis, interactive visualizations, and regional mapping, we analyze the 2013–2015 crisis within both historical and geographic context.</h5>
      <p>While our analysis does not establish causality, it provides descriptive and contextual evidence that helps explain why youth unemployment persisted unevenly across regions, even as some aggregate indicators stabilized.</p>

            This Parallel Coordinates Plot (PCP) helps us analyze which countries had extreme percent change in various economic indicators. 
            Greece is not shown very prominently on this plot because its initial unemployment rate in 2013 was already quite high. This 
            lead us to investigate other variables as to why their unemployment rate remained so steadily high for our identified time period.

      <h1 style="text-align: center;">A Case Study Of Greece: Education, Government Expenditure, and Human Capital</h1>
      <h2>Higher Education in Greece and How This May Affect Unemployment Rate Through Human Capital</h2>
      <p>Throughout the 2000's, Greece had a notably high youth unemployment rate, peaking at 58.5% in 2013.<sup><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.UEM.1524.ZS?locations=GR"><cite>[3]</cite></a></sup>
        Educational attainment is measured as the number of individuals aged 15–64 with tertiary education, meaning they have earned an associate's degree or higher (ISCED levels 5–8).<sup><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/lfst_r_lfsd2pop__custom_19322330/default/table"><cite>[4]</cite></a></sup>
        While this measure does not isolate the variable of youth education specifically, it helps us analyze regional human capital and labor market conditions 
        that influence employment opportunities for young people. We interpret this variable as an important factor in our background context for Greece's 
        possible higher youth unemployment causes rather than a direct measure of youth skills. This data was collected from the EUROSTAT database, where Greece only has tertiary education data available starting from 2015.</p>

        <h3>Greece Dances Its Way Through the 2000s with Drastic Changes in Government Expenditure and Unemployment</h3>
        <p>The 2008 crisis accentuated the rapidly-increasing government debt in Greece, as the government borrowed money 
          in high quantities but failed to collect enough tax revenue. The 2004 Summer Olympic Games in Athens, one of the
          largest government spending projects in the decade, combined with Greece's wish to join the Eurozone and adopt the Euro
          currency to fit in with the rest of the EU, triggered mass spending without enough ways to stabilize debt. In early 2009,
          the government introduced austerity programs, which included a massive cut in government expenditure, which caused the 
          unemployment rate to skyrocket. Without enough government support, new jobs are very hard to sustain and create, and thus 
          many of Greece's youth struggled to become employed. The unemployment rate only began to fall once the government 
          restarted larger spending programs in 2013.</p>
          <p>The following interactive line graph shows the relationship between government expenditure and the unemployment rate.
            A closer look at the exact expenditure or unemployment rate value can be seen by moving the mouse over each respective line.

        <h2> A Historical Analysis of Tourism-Related Prices and Government Expenditure in Greece <br> (1971-2025)</h2>
        <p>
          Although our main project focuses on the years 2013 to 2015, the heatmap uses a longer historical window to add background 
          knowledge to the 2008 Economic crisis and how it affected Greece throughout the early 2010's.
          Using an annual dataset for Greece between 1971 and 2025, we examine the correlations between government 
          expenditure as a share of GDP, tourism-related prices, and the unemployment rate,  to provide historical context for Greece’s overall labor market dynamics during the crisis years of 2013-2015. 
          The heatmap shows how total unemployment, government expenditure growth, and tourism-related prices have 
          moved together over time.<sup><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/tags/series?t=greece"><cite>[5]</cite></a></sup>

      <h1 style = "text-align:center;">So What Does All Of This Mean?</h1>
      <h3>
        Despite having a moderately high amount of international tourism arrivals for a country of its size, Greece experienced economic hardship due to ongoing factors from the 2008 Economic Crisis.
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Greece’s youth unemployment crisis reflects macroeconomic shocks interacting with regional labor market structures.</b><br>
        Although Greece does not exhibit uniformly low tertiary educational attainment at the national level compared to other European countries, higher education alone did not protect young people from unemployment, especially where regional labor markets could not absorb skilled workers.</li>
        <li><b>Reducing youth unemployment requires policies that go beyond just aggregate economic recovery.</b><br>
        Our case study in Greece suggests that investments in education must be paired with region-specific labor market policies, such as job creation that effectively matches the skillset of highly educated people, to effectively improve youth employment in the coming decades.</li>
        <li><b>Unemployment in Greece has historically moved together with government expenditure and tourism-related price indicators.</b><br>
        Our Data in the heatmap, showing data from 1971-2025, suggests that the unemployment and labor market crisis in Greece was a part of a much broader fiscal dynamic, rather than isolated shocks.</li>
      </ul> <br>
      <h2>Ultimately, the case study of Greece demonstrates that youth unemployment cannot be resolved through education or economic recovery alone, but requires policies that address how regional labor markets translate workers' skills into sustainable long-term employment.</h2>
