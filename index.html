    <h1>Indigenous Populations and Mental Health in Canada</h1>

        <h2>Part 2: Distribution of Indigenous Populations Across Canada</h2>
        <p>In general, Indigenous populations are concentrated in the northernmost territories in Canada <br>
            (Nunavut, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories.) Despite having a small population size overall, <br>
            the Inuit peoples make up the majority of the population in Nunavut, being 85% of the population. <br>
            Indigenous people also make up 51% of the population in the Northwest Territories.<br>
            Métis people and people of the First Nations primarily live in the southern territories of Canada, <br>
            while the majority of Inuit people live  in the north. Of course, Nunavut is the territory where most Inuit <br>
            people live, while Quebec and Ontario are the areas where most First Nations people live, and the majority <br>
            of Métis people live in Alberta and Ontario.<br><br></p>

        <h2>Part 3: Mental Health and Food Insecurity</h2>
        <p>1. In general, for both sexes, a smaller percent of non-indigenous people reported having poor mental health <br>
            than indigenous populations. One notable population that experiences a high percentage of poor mental health is <br>
            the First Nations population, and this trend is consistent for both sexes. Overall, a smaller percentage of males <br>
            tends to self-report having poor mental health than females.<br>
            2. A similar trend follows for percentages of the Canadian population that experiences food insecurity. The Inuit <br>
            population experiences the largest proportion of those who struggle with food insecurity, and males have a slightly <br>
            higher self-reported rate of food insecurity.<br>
            3. This relationship that the scatterplot for both sexes suggests is that non-indigenous groups struggle less with <br>
            both mental health and food insecurity since a smaller percentage self-reported experiencing these issues.  <br>
                   This scatterplot for self-reporting males alone shows clusters based on population group, while the relationships <br>
                   for female population groups are more scattered. This suggests women have self-reported more varying rates of <br>
                   poor mental health and food insecurity than men.</p>
