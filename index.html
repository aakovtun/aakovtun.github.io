      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Overview</h2>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Our project aims to explre global tourism data and how it affects global unemployment,
comparing countries with high levels of GDP with their amount of international tourist arrivals,
inflation rates, unemployment rates, and other important economic attributes of interest.</h3> 
        <p>The 2008 Economic crisis caused global macroeconomic shocks, affecting unemployment rates, 
          the amount of GDP generated from tourism and other industries relying on the amount of spending money 
          people have, and housing prices. In the several years that followed, many countries were able to stabilize their
          economies by increasing government spending, lowering interest rates, and implementing tax cuts.<sup><a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/great-recession-and-its-aftermath"><cite>[1]</cite></a></sup>
          
          We gathered a dataset from Kaggle (which assembled several datasets from the World Bank focusing
on international tourist arrivals per country, GDP and inflation rates per country, and tourism
expenditures, among other variables). We noticed that this dataset included lots of missing data,
especially in the years following the COVID-19 pandemic. We counted the number of missing
data per year, and decided that the 2013-2015 range had the least amount of missing data for the
most amount of countries possible. Our preprocessing involved filtering the data to only include
countries that had data for all three of our focus years and getting rid of data about general
geographic regions while only keeping country data. After preprocessing our data, we started to
take note of outliers. Greece, for example, has the highest unemployment rate in our filtered
version of the data, but their other factors (inflation, GDP, and tourism arrivals) do not seem to
match the county’s high unemployment. To answer the question of why exactly Greece had such
high unemployment between 2013-2015, we will do a deeper dive into its government spending
and the differences between the male and female unemployment rates.

            This Parallel Coordinates Plot (PCP) helps us analyze which countries had extreme percent change in various economic indicators. 
            Greece is not shown very prominently on this plot because its initial unemployment rate in 2013 was already quite high. This 
            lead us to investigate other variables as to why their unemployment rate remained so steadily high for our identified time period.

      <h1>A Case Study Of Greece: Education, Government Expenditure, and Human Capital</h1>
      <h2>Higher Education in Greece and How This May Affect Unemployment Rate Through Human Capital</h2>
      <p>Throughout the 2000's, Greece had a notably high youth unemployment rate, peaking at 58.5% in 2013.<sup><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.UEM.1524.ZS?locations=GR"><cite>[2]</cite></a></sup>
        Educational attainment is measured as the number of individuals aged 15–64 with tertiary education, meaning they have earned an associate's degree or higher (ISCED levels 5–8).<sup><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/lfst_r_lfsd2pop__custom_19322330/default/table"><cite>[3]</cite></a></sup>
        While this measure does not isolate the variable of youth education specifically, it helps us analyze regional human capital and labor market conditions 
        that influence employment opportunities for young people. We interpret this variable as an important factor in our background context for Greece's 
        possible higher youth unemployment causes rather than a direct measure of youth skills. </p>
